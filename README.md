# Comprehensive Data Analysis and Statistical Insights


## Overview

This project demonstrates various statistical and data analysis techniques through Python scripts and real-world problem-solving scenarios. It includes tasks such as confidence interval computation, probability analysis, central tendency calculations, and exploratory data analysis on datasets like kerala.csv and Books.csv. The goal is to provide insights and derive meaningful conclusions from data using Python libraries and statistical methods.
## Key Features

- Confidence Interval Calculation:

   Approximation of confidence intervals for proportions.

   Probability computations using normal distribution.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   Analysis of rainfall data to determine flood probabilities.

   Grouping and aggregation of book data to derive insights on author performance.

- Statistical Measures:

   Calculation of mean, median, and mode for datasets.

   Confidence interval estimation for alcohol content in a wine dataset.

- Data Visualization and Cleaning:

  Initial analysis and cleanup of datasets.

  Use of visualizations to present findings.
